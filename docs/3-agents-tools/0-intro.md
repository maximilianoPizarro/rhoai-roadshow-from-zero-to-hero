## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that enables AI assistants to securely access external data sources and tools. MCP servers provide a standardized way for AI applications to interact with various services, databases, and APIs.

For Neuralbank, MCP Agents serve as intelligent intermediaries that:

- **Query Credit Risk Data**: Retrieve customer credit risk information from backend services
- **Update Risk Levels**: Modify credit risk assessments based on loan requests
- **Provide Transparency**: Maintain audit trails for compliance
- **Accelerate Decisions**: Automate manual processes to speed up loan approvals

## LlamaStack Overview

**LlamaStack** is an open-source framework for building production-ready generative AI applications on Kubernetes. It provides a comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform for deploying, managing, and orchestrating Large Language Models (LLMs), tools, agents, and MCP servers at scale.

![LlamaStack Overview](../images/llama-stack.png)

> **Reference**: This section is based on insights from the Red Hat blog post: ["Llama Stack and the case for an open 'run-anywhere' contract for agents"](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/llama-stack-and-case-open-run-anywhere-contract-agents)

### The 4 Layers of LlamaStack

LlamaStack is better understood as four distinct layers, rather than just another agent framework:

#### 1. Build Layer (Client SDK/Toolkit)
A familiar surface for building agents, similar to LangChain, LangFlow, and CrewAI. Developers can author agents using common abstractions. The agent artifacts (YAML configs, Python tasks, tool bindings) are portable across environments.

#### 2. Agent Artifacts and Dependencies
The tangible artifacts of agent development that need runtimes and API endpoints for model inference, tool calling, safety, and telemetry. LlamaStack enables both local development and remote endpoint deployments, ensuring artifacts run consistently regardless of backend models or tools.

#### 3. Platform / API Layer
A standardized API surface for core AI services, including inference, memory, tool use, post-training, data and synthetic generation, and evaluation. LlamaStack has built-in support for:
- **OpenAI-compatible APIs**: One of the few open implementations of OpenAI's APIs (Chat Completions, Responses API, file_search, vectorstores, and more)
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Open protocol for tool calling and standardized communication
- **Extended APIs**: Beyond OpenAI APIs for eval, fine-tuning, model-customization, scoring, and dataset management

#### 4. Provider Model
A plugin system for backends—whether open source or proprietary. This allows you to swap model providers, vector databases, or runtime implementations without touching agent code. Your agent logic remains unchanged while infrastructure can be swapped.

### The Kubernetes Analogy

Much like Kubernetes defined a **control plane + plugin contract** (CNI for networking, CSI for storage, CRI for runtimes) that enabled portability across vendors and clouds, **LlamaStack aims to be the "run-anywhere contract" for agents**:

- **For developers**: The APIs you use and artifacts you produce should run without change across environments
- **For platforms**: The underlying infrastructure (models, vector databases, training runtimes, tool APIs) should be pluggable providers

Think of Kubernetes orchestrating containers, and LlamaStack orchestrating agents and their providers.

### Core Capabilities

LlamaStack offers a complete ecosystem for AI application development:

- **Multiple Model Support**: Seamlessly integrate and switch between various LLM models (Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more) through a unified interface
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Built-in vector database support with automatic embedding generation, enabling context-aware responses from your knowledge base
- **Tools and Agents Framework**: Extensible tool system that allows you to create custom functions and chain them together for complex workflows
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**: Native support for MCP servers, enabling standardized communication between AI assistants and external data sources
- **Playground Interface**: Interactive web-based UI for testing, debugging, and developing AI applications without writing code
- **Kubernetes-Native**: Designed for OpenShift/Kubernetes, providing scalability, reliability, and enterprise security features
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities for production deployments

### Architecture Benefits

LlamaStack's architecture provides several advantages for enterprise AI deployments:

- **Microservices-Based**: Modular design allows independent scaling of components (models, tools, agents)
- **API-First**: RESTful and streaming APIs for easy integration with existing systems
- **Security**: Role-based access control, authentication, and secure communication channels
- **High Availability**: Designed for 99.9% uptime with health checks, auto-recovery, and load balancing
- **Resource Management**: Efficient GPU and CPU utilization with intelligent workload scheduling
- **Open Standards**: Supports both OpenAI-compatible APIs (for compatibility) and open standards like MCP (for vendor independence)

### Integration with Neuralbank

The Neuralbank MCP Agent integrates seamlessly with LlamaStack's Playground, creating a powerful workflow:

1. **Commercial agents** interact with the system through LlamaStack's intuitive chat interface
2. **LlamaStack** routes requests to the MCP Agent using the Model Context Protocol
3. **MCP Agent** processes queries and interacts with Neuralbank's backend services
4. **Results** flow back through LlamaStack to provide real-time responses to commercial agents

This integration enables commercial agents to:
- Query customer credit risk information in natural language
- Update risk levels based on loan application parameters
- Get instant feedback on credit decisions
- Maintain full audit trails for compliance

The combination of LlamaStack's AI capabilities and MCP's standardized protocol creates a robust, scalable solution for Neuralbank's credit risk management needs.

3. You should see the chat interface ready for interaction

#### Step 3: Test the Model

Use the following prompt to test the IBM Granite model's code generation capabilities:

```
Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries (representing products with 'name', 'price', and 'stock') and returns a new list containing only the products that cost more than 50 dollars, sorted from highest to lowest price. Include exception handling in case the price is not a number and add docstrings in Red Hat format.
```

#### Step 4: Review the Response

The model should generate a Python function similar to this:

```python
def filter_expensive_products(products):
    """
    Filter products that cost more than 50 dollars and sort by price.
    
    This function takes a list of product dictionaries and returns a filtered
    and sorted list containing only products with prices above 50 dollars.
    
    Args:
        products (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
            contains 'name', 'price', and 'stock' keys.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only products with price > 50, sorted
            from highest to lowest price.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a list.
        ValueError: If a product dictionary is missing required keys.
    
    Example:
        >>> products = [
        ...     {'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1200, 'stock': 5},
        ...     {'name': 'Mouse', 'price': 25, 'stock': 10},
        ...     {'name': 'Keyboard', 'price': 75, 'stock': 8}
        ... ]
        >>> filter_expensive_products(products)
        [{'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1200, 'stock': 5}, {'name': 'Keyboard', 'price': 75, 'stock': 8}]
    """
    if not isinstance(products, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    
    filtered_products = []
    
    for product in products:
        try:
            # Validate required keys
            if not all(key in product for key in ['name', 'price', 'stock']):
                raise ValueError(f"Product missing required keys: {product}")
            
            # Convert price to number if it's a string
            price = product['price']
            if isinstance(price, str):
                price = float(price)
            
            # Filter products with price > 50
            if isinstance(price, (int, float)) and price > 50:
                filtered_products.append(product)
        except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
            # Handle cases where price is not a number
            print(f"Warning: Skipping product due to invalid price: {product.get('name', 'Unknown')} - {e}")
            continue
    
    # Sort by price from highest to lowest
    filtered_products.sort(key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    
    return filtered_products
```

#### Step 5: Test the Function

You can test the generated function in a Python environment:

```python
# Test with valid products
products = [
    {'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1200, 'stock': 5},
    {'name': 'Mouse', 'price': 25, 'stock': 10},
    {'name': 'Keyboard', 'price': 75, 'stock': 8},
    {'name': 'Monitor', 'price': 300, 'stock': 3}
]

result = filter_expensive_products(products)
print(result)
# Expected: [{'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1200, 'stock': 5}, 
#           {'name': 'Monitor', 'price': 300, 'stock': 3}, 
#           {'name': 'Keyboard', 'price': 75, 'stock': 8}]

# Test with invalid price
products_with_invalid = [
    {'name': 'Product A', 'price': 'not_a_number', 'stock': 5},
    {'name': 'Product B', 'price': 100, 'stock': 2}
]

result = filter_expensive_products(products_with_invalid)
# Should handle the invalid price gracefully and return only Product B
```

#### Expected Results

- ✅ The model generates a complete Python function with proper structure
- ✅ Exception handling is included for invalid price values
- ✅ Docstrings follow Red Hat format (with Args, Returns, Raises, Example sections)
- ✅ The function correctly filters products with price > 50
- ✅ Products are sorted from highest to lowest price
