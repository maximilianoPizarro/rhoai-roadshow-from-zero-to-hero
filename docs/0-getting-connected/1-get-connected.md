# 🔌 Get Connected

Welcome, Kevin! Let's get you connected to the OpenShift AI environment so you can start working on the Neuralbank MCP Agent project.

In this exercise we will:

1. Connect to the OpenShift AI environment
2. Create the OpenShift AI **Project** for the Neuralbank MCP Agent
3. Get familiar with the environment setup
4. Prepare for accessing the Developer Hub and Golden Path
