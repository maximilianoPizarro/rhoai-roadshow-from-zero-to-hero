# ⚙️ Configure Environment

Now that you're connected to OpenShift AI, let's configure your environment for the Neuralbank MCP Agent project.

## Create Your Project

1. In the OpenShift AI console, click **Create project** button on the top right.

2. Type `neuralbank-mcp` in the **Name** text box.

3. Click **Create**

   OpenShift AI creates an empty project for your work.

## Verify Your Access

Ensure you can access:

- **OpenShift Console**: <a href="https://console-openshift-console.apps.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>" target="_blank">https://console-openshift-console.apps.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN></a>
- **OpenShift AI**: Available from the Applications menu
- **Developer Hub**: <a href="https://developer-hub-developer-hub.apps.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>" target="_blank">https://developer-hub-developer-hub.apps.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN></a>

## Environment Variables

Make sure you have the following information ready:

- **Cluster Domain**: `<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>` (set in the top navigation bar)
- **Project Name**: `neuralbank-mcp`
- **Username**: Your OpenShift username
- **Password**: Your OpenShift password

## Next Steps

Your environment is now configured. In the next section, you'll learn about the **Golden Path** and how to use the Developer Hub to create your development workspace.

?> **Tip** Keep your cluster domain handy - you'll use it throughout this journey. Set it in the top navigation bar and click `Save` to update all documentation links.
